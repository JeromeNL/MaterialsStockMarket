<h1>MaterialsStockMarket</h1>

MaterialsStockMarket allows you to simulate "commodity trading" on your Minecraft server! You can add up to 27 items to the nice looking buy/sell GUI. Ofcourse, you as admin can decide what the current buy and sell prices are.


<h2>Permissions</h2>
If you want to give a player access to the trading GUI, you have to give him just one permission: 
MaterialsStockMarket.open
It is recommended to give the player access to 'Essentials.balance'. This way, the player is able to check his current balance.

<h2>Change items/prices</h2>
If you want to add/remove items or change the prices, you have to edit the config.yml file. This file is automatic generated by adding the plugin (.jar) to your server plugins folder.

<h2>Future updates</h2>
- Automatic price generation</br>
- A better/more extensive trading GUI</br>
- In-game commands for adding/removing/change items and prices (admin only)</br>

<h2>The default config.yml</h2>
If you would like to reset your config.yml, please use the one from the GitHub Repository.
